# INFRASTRUCTURE - Configurable Infrastructure Settings
# =====================================================
# Settings that help configure the application's infrastructure.
#
# Changes made to this file directly effect the Terraform code in the
# ``terraform`` & ``terraform/shared`` directories.
#
# Changes **DO NOT** effect Terraform code in the ``terraform/dependencies``
# directory (with the exception of ``terraform/dependencies/backend.tf``)
#
# .. ATTENTION::
#   In order to apply any changes made to this file, you **must** run:
#   ``bash> tsunami app update``
#
# The ``tsunami app update`` command may also change files outside of the
# ``terraform`` directory.
#
# Also note that information in other TAC YAML files may have effect on the
# Terraform code.
#
# Any changes made by the ``tsunami app update`` command are made locally to
# this TAC repo. As such, you will be able to review those changes before
# committing them back to BitBucket.
