Earth: Mostly Harmless.

The Tsunami Reference Application for In-Place deployments.

This application is meant to serve as documentation on how to set up and use a
Tsunami Application Config repository as well as being a working application that
can be deployed and used for Tsunami development and testing purposes.

It is the Golden template of what makes up a Tsunami In-Place App. It is used
as the basis for creating new Tsunami In-Place Apps. 

```{NOTE}
This app is not meant to be used as a generic test application.
